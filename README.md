In the my_emacs folder, you will find two different emacs conf, one pretty simple but usefull, the other one much more powefull.

For simple emacs :
Here is my emacs conf with some different keybinding and colors, don't forget that you need to place both files at your home and rename them like a hidden file.
Here's the keys I rebinded:
       -Open a new file : ctrl + f
       -Open a new widnow in emacs : ctrl + p
       -Close it : ctrl + a
       -Switch to a window from another : Alt + arrows

For arrogant emacs :
