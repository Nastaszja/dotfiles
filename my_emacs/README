This isn't my emacs conf, i just modified some files and colors from the arrogant emacs conf (Find it on github)
You just have to copy the emacs.d and emacs file in your home.
Example :
cp -r emacs.d ~/.emacs.d
cp emacs ~/.emacs
Then launch emacs and wait.
If you have an error, you may not have the color-themes package, so just download it.
